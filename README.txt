# CK2 AAR Chronicle Editor

The CK2 AAR Chronicle Editor is an interactive web application designed to streamline the process of creating narrative content for "After Action Reports" (AAR) for the game Crusader Kings II. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for authors to craft their stories, organize their thoughts, and structure their narratives with ease.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Blocks**: Add and manage various types of content blocks, including text, titles, and images, to build your story.
- **Auto-Expanding Text Areas**: Write without constraints as text areas expand automatically to fit your narrative.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Save your work in progress directly to your browser's local storage to prevent data loss between sessions.
- **Manual Save Button**: Manually save the current state of your work with a simple click, ensuring that all recent changes are captured.
- **Drag-and-Drop Image Uploads**: Easily upload images to accompany your narrative, with previews displayed instantly.
- **Customizable Titles**: Set the title for each chapter of your AAR to keep your work organized.
- **Deletion Capability**: Remove any block of content at any time, allowing for flexible editing.

## How It Works

The editor utilizes JavaScript to provide a dynamic and responsive experience. Content blocks can be added or removed on the fly, and the text within them is automatically saved to local storage upon changes. The application also features a manual save button for users who prefer to control when their data is saved.

## Future Enhancements

- **Export to Markdown**: Functionality to export the entire narrative to a markdown file for easy sharing and publishing.
- **Cloud Sync**: Option to sync your work across devices via cloud storage services.
- **Enhanced Editing Tools**: Rich text editing capabilities for a more polished final product.

This project is perfect for CK2 enthusiasts who love to document and share their in-game exploits through AARs. It simplifies the creative process, allowing storytellers to focus on crafting compelling narratives for the CK2 community.
